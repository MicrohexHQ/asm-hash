# asm-hash
A collection of common [cryptographic hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash) written in C and assembly.

## Goal
This project began as a exercise to learn and practice assembly for ARMv6-CPUs and also to learn about cryptographic hash functions. Because these hash functions only need simple arithmetic and logical integer operations, it's a great exercise for beginners. In order to be portable and fast, everything is written in portable C and the speed critical parts are written in assembly. The assembly code is tested on the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). 

## Implemented Hash Algorithms
* MD5
* SHA-1
* SHA-2 (224, 256, 384, 512, 512/224 and 512/256 variants)
